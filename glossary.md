     of the waterfall page.
*    __symbolication__:  The process of resolving stack addresses and backtraces
     to human readable source code methods/lines/etc...
*    __tree__:  This means the source tree in subversion. Often used in the

     bookmark allowing them to edit properties or cancel the addition.

     channels.
*    __clicking__:  Audio artifacts caused by bad/corrupted samples.

     video files.
*    __sample__:  A single uncompressed audio unit. Changes depending on the
     format but is typically a signed 16-bit integer.
*    __sample bits__:  The number of bits per audio sample. Typical values are
     8, 16, 24 or 32.
*    __sample rate__:  The number of audio samples per second. Typical values
     for compressed audio formats (AAC/MP3/Vorbis) are 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz.
*    __stuttering__:  Short video or audio pauses. Makes the playback look/sound
     jerky, and is often caused by insufficient data or processor.

     testing. ASan detects addressability issues (buffer overflow, use after free
     etc), LSan detects memory leaks, MSan detects use of uninitialized memory and
     TSan detects data races.
*    __AFDO__:  Automatic FDO; see FDO & PGO.
*    __FDO__:  Feedback-Directed Optimization; see AFDO & PGO.

     for examples.
*    __devserver__:  System for updating packages on a Chromium OS device
     without having to use a USB stick or doing a full reimage. See the
     [Dev Server page](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/how-tos-and-troubleshooting/using-the-dev-server).
*    __powerwash__:  Wiping of the stateful partition (system & all users) to
     get a device back into a pristine state. The TPM is not cleared, and Lockbox is
     kept intact (thus it is not the same as a factory reset). See the
     [Powerwash design doc](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/powerwash).
