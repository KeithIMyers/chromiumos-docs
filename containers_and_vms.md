# Running Custom Containers Under Chrome OS

Welcome to the containers project where we support running arbitrary code inside
of [VM]s in Chrome OS.
This is a heavily-technical document, but more user-friendly information will be
coming in the future.

We won't get into technical details for specific projects as each one already
has relevant documentation.
We instead will link to them for further reading.

[TOC]

## Overview

There are many codenames and technologies involved in this project, so hopefully
we can demystify things here.

[Crostini] is the umbrella term for making Linux application support easy to use
and integrating well with Chrome OS.
It largely focuses on getting you a [Terminal] with a container with easy access
to install whatever developer-focused tools you might want.
It's the default first-party experience.

The [Terminal] app is the first entry point to that environment.
It's basically just [crosh].
It takes care of kicking off everything else in the system that you'll interact
with.

[crosvm] is a custom virtual machine monitor that takes care of managing [KVM],
the guest [VM], and facilitating the low-level ([virtio]-based) communication.

[Termina] is a [VM] image with a stripped-down Chrome OS linux kernel and
userland tools.
Its only goal is to boot up as quickly as possible and start running containers.
Many of the programs/tools are custom here.
In hindsight, we might not have named it one letter off from "Terminal", but so
it goes.

[Concierge] is a daemon that runs in Chrome OS which handles lifecycle
management of VMs and containers and uses gRPC over vsock to communicate with
a daemon in the VM.

[Maitred] is our init and service/container manager inside of the [VM], and is
responsible for communicating with [Concierge] (which runs outside of the [VM]).
[Concierge] sends it requests and [Maitred] is responsible for carrying those
out.

[Cicerone] is a daemon that runs in Chrome OS which handles all communication
directly with the container using gRPC over IP.

[Garcon] runs inside the container and provides integration with
[Cicerone]/Chrome for more convenient/natural behavior.
For example, if the container wants to open a URL, [Garcon] takes care of
plumbing that request back out.

[Sommelier] is a [Wayland] proxy compositor that runs inside the container.
[Sommelier] provides seamless forwarding of contents, input events, clipboard
data, etc... between [Wayland] applications inside the container and Chrome.

Chrome does not run an [X] server or otherwise support the [X] protocol;
thus [Sommelier] is also responsible for starting up [XWayland] (in rootless
mode), acting as the [X] window manager to the clients, and translating the
[X] protocol inside the container into the [Wayland] protocol for Chrome.

You can launch [crosh] and use the [vmc] command to create new [VM]s manually.
It will only run [Termina] at this point in time.
You can then use [vsh] to connect to a [VM] instance and use [LXC] to run
arbitrary containers.

The default container launched via [Terminal] is [Debian] with custom packages.
See [cros-container-guest-tools] for more details.

In this flow, the [VM] is named `termina` and the container is `penguin`.

## Quickstart

Here's a quick run down of how to get started.
*   Buy a [Google Pixelbook](https://store.google.com/product/google_pixelbook).
    It is our objectively biased opinion that it's a nice piece of hardware.
*   Switch to the
    [dev channel](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1086915).
*   Enable support.
    *   Go to Chrome OS settings (chrome://settings).
    *   Scroll down to "Linux (Beta)".
    *   Turn it on!
*   Open the app switcher (press the Search/Launcher key) and type "[Terminal]".
*   Launch the [Terminal] app.
*   Profit!

If you're interested in [Android Studio], check out their documentation.

## Runtime Features

OK, so you've got your container going, but what exactly can you expect to work?

* Outbound network connections (IPv4).
* Unaccelerated Graphics.
* [Wayland] programs (preferred; via [Sommelier]).
* [X] programs (compatibility via [Sommelier] and [XWayland]).

### Missing Features

There's a lot of low-hanging fruit we're working on fleshing out.

* [Audio support](https://crbug.com/781398).
* Peripheral access ([USB](https://crbug.com/831850)/Bluetooth/etc...).
* [Accelerated graphics](https://crbug.com/837209).
* Video hardware decoding.
* [IMEs](https://crbug.com/826614).

There are more things we're thinking about, but we're being very
careful/cautious in rolling out features as we want to make sure we aren't
compromising overall system security in the process.
The (large) FAQ below should hopefully hit a lot of those topics.

## Security

While running arbitrary code is normally a security risk, we believe we've come
up with a runtime model that sufficiently mitigates & contains the code.
The [VM] is our security boundary, so everything inside of the [VM] is
considered untrusted.
Our current [VM] guest image is also running our hardened kernel to further
improve the security of the containers, but we consider this a nice feature
rather than relying on it for overall system security.

In this model, the rest of the Chrome OS system should remain protected from
arbitrary code (malicious or accidental) that runs inside of the containers
inside of the [VM].

The only contact with the outside world is via [crosvm], and each channel
talks to individual processes (each of which are heavily sandboxed).

### User Data In The Container

With the shift to cloud services, current security thinking highlights the fact
that getting account credentials
(e.g. [your Google/Facebook passwords](https://xkcd.com/1200/))
is way more interesting than attacking your desktop/laptop.
They are not wrong.
The current [VM]/container Chrome OS solution does not currently improve on
this.
Put plainly, anything entered into the container is the responsibility of the
user currently.
So if you run an insecure/compromised container, and then type your passwords
into the container, they can be stolen even while the rest of the Chrome OS
system remains secure.

### Persistence

Processes in [VM]s and containers do not survive logout (since they live in the
user's encrypted storage) and are killed automatically.
They also do not automatically start at login (to avoid persistent attacks),
nor can they automatically run at boot (without a login session) since they
wouldn't be accessible (as they're in the user's encrypted storage).

### Executable & Writable Code

The [Termina] [VM] disk image is downloaded to the writable stateful partition
like other Chrome [component]s.
In order to make sure the contents aren't modified, we use [dm-verity].
This also means only images signed by Google may be loaded, and the image is
always read-only.

### Hardware Attacks

The Meltdown/Spectre vulnerabilities have implications for safely using [VM]s.
We've applied fixes/mitigations to make sure [VM]s can't attack the host system
or other [VM]s.
See the [Chromium OS wiki page](http://dev.chromium.org/chromium-os/meltdown-spectre-vulnerability-status)
for more details.

## Lifecycles

Once you've got the [Terminal] installed (which takes care of installing all
the other necessary components like [Termina]), the system is ready to use.

By virtue of having things installed, nothing starts running right away.
In that regard, when you log out, everything is shut down and killed, and when
you log in, nothing is automatically restarted.

When you run the [Terminal], the [Termina] [VM] will be started automatically,
and the default [Crostini] container will be started in that.
You can now connect to the container via SSH or SFTP (via the Files app).

Similarly, if you run a Linux application directly (e.g. pinned to your shelf
or via the launcher), the [Termina] [VM] will be started automatically, and
the container that application belongs to will be launched.
There's no need to run [Terminal] manually in these situations.

When you close all visible applications, the [VM]/containers are not shut down.
If you want to manually stop them, you can do so via [crosh] and the [vmc]
command.

Similarly, if you want to spawn independent [VM]s, or more containers, you can
do so via [crosh] and the [vmc] and [vsh] commands.

### Persistence

All the [VM]s and containers created, and the data within those containers,
will persist across user sessions (logout/login).
They are kept in the same per-user encrypted storage as the rest of the
browser's data.

If a [VM] or container are stopped or killed ungracefully (e.g. powerloss),
then data might be lost and need recovery like anything else in the system.

## Device Support

While we would like to be able to bring this work to all Chromebooks, the
required kernel and hardware features limit where we can deploy this.
A lot of features we use had to be backported, and the further back we go, the
more difficult & risky it is to do so.
We don't want to compromise system stability and security here.

### Supported Now

The initial platform is the Google Pixelbook (eve) running an Intel processor
(x86_64) with Linux 4.4.

### Hardware Requirements

We are not planning on requiring a minimum amount of RAM, storage, or CPU speed,
but certainly the more you have of each, the better the system will perform.

You will need a CPU that has hardware virtualization support.

## FAQ

### Where can I chat with developers?

All Chromium OS development discussions happen in our
[chromium-os-dev Google Group][chromium-os-dev].
Feel free to ask anything!

### Where can I file feature requests?

As a nascent project, we've got a lot on our plate and planning on releasing,
so it'd be nice to hold off for now and check back in after a few Chrome OS
releases.

Feel free to chat/ask on the mailing list above in the meantime.

Once we are in a more stable place, you can use our issue tracker.
See the next question for details.

### Where can I file bugs?

Please first make sure you're using the latest dev channel.
A lot of work is still ongoing.

Next, please make sure the issue isn't already known or fixed.
You can check the existing bug list.

If you still want to send feedback, you can [file a feedback
report][feedback-report] and include `#crostini` in the description.
Feedback about any part of Chrome OS can be filed with "Alt-Shift-i".

If you still want to file a bug with the developers, use [this link][new-bug] to
route to the right people.

### Can I boot another OS like Windows, macOS, Linux, *BSD, etc...?

Currently, no, you can only boot our custom Linux [VM] named [Termina].
See also the next few questions.

### Can I run my own VM/kernel?

Currently, no, you can only boot [Termina] which uses our custom Linux kernel
and configs.
Stay tuned!

### Can I run a different Linux distro?

Of course!
The full LXD command line is available, and the included images remote has lots
of other distros to choose from.
However, we don't test with anything other than the default container that we
ship, so things may be broken when running another distro.

### I'm running <insert distro here>, how do I get {GUI apps, launcher icons, etc...}?

[Sommelier] and [Garcon] binaries are bind-mounted into every container, so no
need to install or cross-compile.
The systemd units and config files from [cros-container-guest-tools] will start
these daemons in a systemd user session.
It's also a good idea to run `loginctl enable-linger <user>` to allow these to
remain running in the background.

### Am I running Crostini?

If you're using the [Terminal] app, or programs in the default container we
provide that includes our programs to ease integration (e.g. [Sommelier]), then
yes.

If you're running your own container or [VM], then no.

### How do I share files between Chrome OS & the container?

Using [Secure Shell], you can set up a SFTP mount to the remote container and
then browse via the Files app.
Work is on going to automate this step by default.

### Can I access files when the container isn't running?

Currently, the container must be running in order to access its content.

### Can I install custom kernel modules?

Currently, no, [Termina] does not include module support.
That means trying to use software that requires building or loading custom
kernel modules (e.g. VirtualBox) will not work.
See the next question too.

### Can I mount filesystems?

Currently, no (*).
The containers are implemented using Linux [user namespaces] and those are quite
restricted (by design).
We're looking into [supporting FUSE](https://crbug.com/841787) though.

(*): Technically you can mount a few limited pseudo filesystems (like
memory-backed tmpfs), but most people aren't interested in those.

### Can I use loop devices?

Currently, no.
See the previous question about mounting filesystems.

Specifically, we're referring to `losetup` and `mount -o loop` which use
`/dev/loop-control` and nodes like `/dev/loop0` via the `loop` kernel module.

If you have a use case that wouldn't be solved by supporting
[FUSE](https://crbug.com/841787), please [file a bug][new-bug] for us.

### Can I run a VM inside the VM?

Currently, no, nested [KVM] is not supported.
You could run qemu-system to emulate the hardware and boot whatever OS you want
inside of that.
Unfortunately, it'll be quite slow as [QEMU] won't be able to utilize [KVM] for
hardware acceleration.

### Can I run a container inside the container?

Yes!
You'll probably need to install the relevant packages first for whatever
container format you want to run.

### What container formats are supported?

[Termina] currently only supports [LXC] directly.
We're aware of Kubernetes/Docker/OCI/rkt/etc... and hope to make them all easy
to use.

See the previous question for a workaround in the mean time.

### What architecture works on my system?

Since everything is all native code execution, it depends on the device you
have.

If you don't know what device you have, you can find this out in two different
ways:
*   Open chrome://settings/help/details and look at the Platform,
    then match the board name with our
    [public device list](http://dev.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices).
    Look at the "User ABI" field to see what kind of CPU you have.
*   Open up [crosh] and run `uname -m`.
    This will print the architecture of your current device.

If you see `x86_64`, you'll be able to run code compiled for Intel/AMD
(32-bit/64-bit/x32 should all work).

If you see `arm` (or something similar like `armv7l`) or `aarch64`, you'll be
able to run code compiled for ARM/ARM64.

### Can I run other architectures?

There is currently no integrated support for running e.g. ARM code on an Intel
system, or vice-versa.
You could handle this yourself (e.g. by using qemu-user), but if you're familiar
with qemu-user, then you already know that :).

### How many VMs can I run?

You can spawn as many as your system can handle (RAM/CPU-wise).
They are all independent of each other.

### How many containers can I run?

You can spawn as many as your system can handle (RAM/CPU-wise).
Each [VM] instance can host multiple containers.

### Can I run programs that keep running after logout?

Nope!
All [VM]s (and their containers) are tied to your login session.
As soon as you log out, all programs are shut down/killed by design.

Since all your data lives in your encrypted home, we wouldn't want that to
possibly leak when you log out.

For more details, see the [Security] section in this doc.

### Can I autorun programs when I log in?

Nope!
All [VM]s (and their containers) need to be manually relaunched.
This helps prevent persistent exploits.

For more details, see the [Security] section in this doc.

### Can I autorun programs when I boot?

Nope!
See the previous questions, and the [Security] section.

### Are my VMs/containers/data synced/backed up?

Currently, no, nothing is synced or backed up.
You're responsible for any data going into the containers.

We hope to improve this situation greatly.

### Can I access the VM/container files directly (e.g. via the Files app)?

Currently, no, there is no way to access the image files used by the [VM].
There are no plans to change this.

If you want to back things up, you'll need to do so by hand.

### Do I have to manage VM updates?

Nope!
The [Termina] [VM] is a [component] that is updated automatically.

Keep in mind that the [VM] is separate from the container.

### How do I check the Termina version?

Since [Termina] is a downloaded component, you can visit chrome://components
and look for `cros-termina`.

You can also connect to a [VM] via [vsh] and run `cat /etc/lsb-release`.

### Do I have to manage container updates?

Currently, yes.
The container is like any other Linux distro out there, so you'll need to update
it from time to time if you want newer software.

You can run `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`.

### Can I use IPv6?

Unfortunately, only IPv4 is currently supported.
Yes, we're fully aware that everything should be IPv6-compatible in 2018.
We're working on it.

### Can I access layer 2 networking?

Currently, no, networking access is only at layer 3 (i.e. IP).
So you won't be able to do any bridging or lower level fun stuff.

It's not clear if/when this will change.
Bridging with the outside world is difficult with WiFi, and not many devices
have Ethernet connections.
We could support layer 2 between containers, but it's not clear how many people
want this in order to justify the effort involved.

### Can I access hardware (e.g. USB/Bluetooth/serial)?

Currently, no, but we are working on it.
Stay tuned!

### Can I run graphical applications?

Yes, but currently things are unaccelerated.
So if you're looking to play the latest Quake game, it's not going to work well.
See the next few questions.

### Can I run Wayland programs?

Yes, and in fact, these are preferred!
Chrome itself deals with [Wayland] clients heavily, and so you're much more
likely to have things "just work" if you upgrade.

[Sommelier] provides this support seamlessly.

### Can I run X programs?

Yes, although you might run into some compatibility kinks, and it probably will
never be as perfect as running a traditional [X] server.
However, with the wider community moving to [Wayland], it should be good enough.

[Sommelier] takes care of launching [XWayland], acting as the [WM], and
otherwise translating [X] and [Wayland] requests between Chrome and the
[X] programs.

### Why are windows sometimes tiny/fuzzy?

While Chrome supports [high DPI][HiDPI] displays, many Linux applications don't.
When a program doesn't properly support [DPI] scaling, poor results follow.

Currently we expose the native resolution and [DPI] directly to applications.
If they show up tiny or fuzzy, it's because they don't support scaling properly.
You should report these issues to the respective upstream projects so that,
hopefully someday, it'll "just work".

In the mean time, [Sommelier] exposes some runtime settings so you can set the
scale factor on a per-program basis to work around the misbehavior.
Check out [Sommelier]'s documentation for more details.

If you're applying a system-wide zoom or otherwise changing the default display
resolution, we attempt to scale the application output to match.
This can lead to blurry results.
You can adjust the resolution of your display, or tweak things via [Sommelier]
(see above for more details).

### Can I run Windows programs?

Sure, give [WINE] a try.
Compatibility will largely depend on [WINE] though, so please don't ask us for
support.

### Can I run Steam?

Sure, give [Steam] a shot.
Just remember that without accelerated graphics or sound, it's probably not
going to be too much fun.

### Can I run macOS programs?

Probably not.
You could try various existing Linux solutions, but chances are good that they
are even rougher around the edges.

### Can I develop Android apps (for ARC++)?

Check out the [Android Studio] site for more details on this.

### Why implement crosvm from scratch (instead of using QEMU/kvmtool/etc...)?

We have nothing against any of these other projects.
In fact, they're all pretty great, and their designs influenced ours.
Most significantly, they did more than we needed and did not have as good a
security model as we were able to attain by writing our own.
While [crosvm] cannot do everything those other projects can, it does only what
we need it to.

For more details, check out the [crosvm] project.

### Why run VMs?  Aren't containers secure?

While containers often isolate themselves (via Linux [namespaces]), they do not
isolate the kernel or similar system resources.
That means it only takes a single bug in the kernel to fully exploit the system
and steal your data.

That isn't good enough for Chrome OS, hence we put everything inside a [VM].
Now you have to exploit [crosvm] via its limited interactions with the guest,
and [crosvm] itself is heavily sandboxed.

For more details, see the [Security] section in this doc.

### Don't Android apps (ARC++) run in a container and not a VM?

Unfortunately, yes, Android apps currently run only in a container.

We try to isolate them quite a bit (using [namespaces], [seccomp],
[alt syscall], [SELinux], etc...), but at the end of the day, they have direct
access to many syscalls and kernel interfaces, so a bug in there is reachable
via code compiled with Android's NDK.

### If Android apps are in a container, why can't users run code too?

We don't usually accept a low security bar in one place as a valid reason to
lower the security bar everywhere.
Instead, we want to constantly raise the security bar for all code.

### Are Android apps (ARC++) going away?

There are no plans to merge the two projects.
We share/re-use a lot of the Chrome bridge code though, so it's not like we're
doing everything from scratch.

### Don't VMs slow everything down?

It is certainly true that [VM]s add overhead when compared to running in only
a container or directly in the system.
However, in our tests, the overhead is negligble to the user experience, and
well worth the strong gains in system security.

For more details, see the [Security] section in this doc.

### Why run containers inside the VM?  Why not run programs directly in the VM?

In order to keep [VM] startup times low, we need [Termina] to be as slim as
possible.
That means cutting out programs/files we don't need or are about.

We use [dm-verity] which requires the [Termina] image be read-only for
[Security], but it also means we can safely share it between [VM] instances.

Further, the versions of programs/libraries we ship are frequently newer than
other distros (since we build off of [Gentoo]), and are compiled with extra
security flags.

Allowing user modifications to the [VM] prevents a stateless image that always
works and is otherwise immune from user mistakes and bugs in programs.

Altogether, it's difficult to support running arbitrary programs, and would
result in a system lacking many desired properties outlined above.
Forcing everything into a container produces a more robust solution, and
allows users to freely experiment without worry.

Also, [we love turtles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down).

### Can I delete containers I no longer want?

Sure, feel free to delete whatever you want.
However, there is no UI or commands currently to help with this.

Note: The default [Crostini] container is named `penguin`.

### Can I delete VMs I no longer want?

Sure, feel free to delete whatever you want.
The `vmc destroy` command can be used to delete them manually.

Note: The default [Crostini] [VM] is named `termina`.

### Can I disable these features?

Administrators can control access to containers/[VM]s via the management
console, so enterprise/education organizations that want to limit this can.

Initially there is a "Linux (Beta)" option under the standard Chrome OS
settings, but the long-term plan is to remove this knob so things work
on-demand.
At which point, there will be no knob for unmanaged devices.
