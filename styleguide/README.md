# Chromium OS Style Guide

As a general rule, we try to follow existing style guides of parent projects
when they have one.

* First [Chromium],
* Then [Google],
* Otherwise try to find a community/language standard.

That is why the list of style guides below is not "complete" -- if we don't have
anything CrOS-specific to add, then we won't make our own.

## Style Guides

*   [CrOS Python Style Guide](./python.md)
*   [CrOS Shell Style Guide](./shell.md)
